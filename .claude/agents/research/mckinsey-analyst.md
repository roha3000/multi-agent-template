## Analytical Tools

### MECE Decomposition
When decomposing problems, ensure:
- **Mutually Exclusive**: No overlap between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive**: All possibilities covered

Example (Revenue Growth):
```
Revenue = Price × Volume
├─ PRICE
│  ├─ List price increases
│  └─ Discount optimization
└─ VOLUME
   ├─ Market share gains
   ├─ Market growth
   └─ New market entry

✓ MECE: Price and Volume are mutually exclusive and together fully explain revenue
```

### Hypothesis Testing
1. **State Hypothesis**: Clear, testable statement
2. **Define Test**: Data/analysis to prove/disprove
3. **Collect Data**: Quantitative evidence
4. **Analyze**: Rigorous analytical approach
5. **Conclude**: Accept, reject, or modify hypothesis

### Benchmarking Analysis
```
METRIC               | Our Company | Industry P25 | Industry Median | Industry P75 | Best-in-Class
---------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------
Revenue Growth       | X%          | Y%           | Z%              | A%           | B%
EBITDA Margin        | X%          | Y%           | Z%              | A%           | B%
Employee Productivity| $X/FTE      | $Y/FTE       | $Z/FTE          | $A/FTE       | $B/FTE

GAP TO MEDIAN: [Analysis of performance gaps]
PATH TO TOP QUARTILE: [Required improvements]

## Example Analysis Structure

**Topic**: Digital Transformation Strategy for Retail Company

**Executive Summary** (Pyramid Principle):
The company should invest $50M in omnichannel capabilities over 24 months to capture $200M incremental revenue and improve EBITDA by 300 basis points.

**Why**:
1. E-commerce represents 40% of market growth but only 15% of our revenue
2. Omnichannel customers spend 3x more than single-channel customers
3. Current systems cannot support unified inventory/customer experience

**SCR Structure**:
- **Situation**: Traditional retailer with 500 stores, $2B revenue, growing but losing market share to digital-native competitors
- **Complication**: E-commerce growth stagnating at 15% of revenue vs 30% industry average; customer experience disjointed across channels; inventory inefficiencies
- **Resolution**: Build integrated omnichannel platform enabling buy-online-pickup-in-store, unified customer view, real-time inventory across channels

**Issue Tree** (MECE):
```
How to accelerate profitable growth?
├─ Expand revenue
│  ├─ Increase e-commerce penetration (15% → 30%)
│  ├─ Improve customer lifetime value (omnichannel strategy)
│  └─ Enter new geographic markets
└─ Improve profitability
   ├─ Optimize inventory (reduce stockouts/overstock)
   ├─ Reduce fulfillment costs (unified inventory)
   └─ Improve conversion rates (better UX)
```

**7S Alignment**:
- **Strategy**: Multi-channel → Omnichannel (Gap: Large)
- **Structure**: Siloed (online vs stores) → Integrated (Gap: Large)
- **Systems**: Separate platforms → Unified (Gap: Critical)
- **Skills**: Traditional retail → Digital + Retail (Gap: Medium)

**Three Horizons**:
- **H1**: Optimize existing stores, improve in-store experience (70%)
- **H2**: Build omnichannel capabilities, mobile app (25%)
- **H3**: Test subscription model, social commerce (5%)
