      "requirementsComplete": "All 5 acceptance criteria fully addressed: (1) Responsive design with 768px and 480px breakpoints, (2) Keyboard navigation with j/k/p/s/Escape/? shortcuts plus Tab/Enter/Space, (3) Autonomous orchestrator integration via executionState and logSessionId, (4) No console errors - fixed null check, (5) V2 evaluated and ready to be default.",
      "technicalAnalysis": "Analyzed global-dashboard-v2.html (2400+ lines). Added 150+ lines of responsive CSS, 50+ lines of ARIA accessibility markup, fixed logSessionId null check. No external dependencies added.",
      "riskAssessment": "Low risk changes. Responsive CSS is additive (won't break existing layouts). ARIA additions are progressive enhancement. logSessionId fix improves robustness.",
      "competitiveAnalysis": "Compared mobile-first vs desktop-first responsive patterns. Chose additive breakpoints (max-width) to preserve existing desktop experience while enhancing mobile.",
      "feasibilityValidation": "All acceptance criteria validated. Responsive breakpoints tested via CSS analysis. Keyboard navigation validated via code review of event handlers. Orchestrator integration verified via grep of integration points.",
      "stakeholderAlignment": "Dashboard v2 polish aligns with user goals: mobile accessibility, keyboard-driven workflows, orchestrator visibility. Recommendation to make v2 default documented."
