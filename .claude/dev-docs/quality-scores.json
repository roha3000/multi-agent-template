      "rationale": "All 8 acceptance criteria well-defined: hook execution, decision accuracy, user control skills, Task tool execution, dashboard visibility, test coverage (160+), documentation, performance targets (<200ms hook, <500ms decision). Functional and non-functional requirements documented in 5 design docs. Minor: Could specify more edge cases for partial delegation failures."

DelegationDecider (891 lines), TaskDecomposer (994 lines), HierarchyRegistry (716 lines), AgentOrchestrator (1434 lines) all production-ready with 127 tests passing. Hook infrastructure proven (11 hooks, user-prompt-submit.js extensible). Technology choices validated through implementation. Architecture documented in AUTO-DELEGATION-ARCHITECTURE.md."

      "score": 90,
      "weight": 15,
      "rationale": "Risks identified with mitigations: Hook breaks Claude Code (graceful error handling, timeouts), Wrong decisions (tunable thresholds, manual override), Sub-agent failures (retry logic, partial success), Performance degradation (caching, async), User confusion (clear UX, docs). Implementation plan has risk section. Minor gap: No rollback strategy for failed delegations mid-execution."

      "rationale": "Design references successful patterns (Webpack hooks, Chrome Extensions, Drupal). Hybrid hook + event approach. No direct competitor analysis (auto-delegation for AI agents is novel). Design docs compare hook vs. skills vs. CLAUDE.md approaches. Could benefit from more research into other multi-agent frameworks."

      "rationale": "Technical feasibility confirmed: All core components exist and tested. Hook mechanism proven (session-start, track-progress hooks work). Performance targets achievable (<200ms hook - baseline <50ms, <500ms decision - already implemented). 127 delegation tests pass. 6-phase implementation plan with realistic estimates. Only unknown: actual Task tool integration in Claude Code environment."

      "rationale": "UX design comprehensive with user journeys, control mechanisms, feedback systems. 4 delegation modes (disabled, suggest, auto, smart) give user control. /delegate and /direct commands for manual override. Dashboard integration planned. Minor: No user testing or feedback collection mechanism designed yet."
