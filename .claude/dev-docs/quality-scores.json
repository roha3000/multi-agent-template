      "score": 100,
      "weight": 25,
      "rationale": "All 4 acceptance criteria verified through code analysis: (1) delegateTask() and _executeWithDelegation() spawn sub-agents via Task tool concept, (2) executeParallel() uses Promise.allSettled for concurrent execution, (3) _executeSequentialDelegation() chains tasks respecting order, (4) HierarchyRegistry tracks all relationships with byParent/byDepth/byStatus indexes."

      "weight": 20,
      "rationale": "Comprehensive analysis of 5 core modules totaling ~5,000 lines: AgentOrchestrator (1434 lines, 5 patterns), DelegationDecider (891 lines, 6 factors), TaskDecomposer (993 lines, 4 strategies), HierarchyRegistry (715 lines, 3 indexes), DelegationBridge (781 lines, 2-tier analysis).

    "riskAssessment": {
      "score": 92,
      "weight": 15,
      "rationale": "Key risks identified and mitigated: (1) Depth limits enforced (maxDepth=3) prevent infinite delegation, (2) Children limits (maxChildren=10) prevent explosion, (3) Cycle detection in HierarchyRegistry, (4) Graceful degradation in DelegationBridge if modules fail to load, (5) Timeout handling in all execution methods. Minor risk: Task tool integration needs testing in production."

      "score": 85,
      "weight": 15,
      "rationale": "Analyzed existing patterns against industry standards. Debate pattern similar to Constitutional AI multi-agent approach. Review pattern follows standard create-critique-revise workflow. Ensemble pattern provides redundancy similar to ensemble ML methods. Could benefit from analysis of other multi-agent frameworks like AutoGen, CrewAI."
