# PROJECT SUMMARY - Multi-Agent Template with Production Telemetry
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-17 (Session 12)

**Current Phase**: Continuous Loop Implementation
**Status**: Building automated session cycling with external orchestration

---

## Session 12: Continuous Loop Implementation

### Problem Statement
Claude Code cannot clear its own context from within a CLI session. This prevents fully automated long-running tasks that exceed the context window.

### Solution: External Orchestration Pattern
Inspired by [continuous-claude](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/continuous-claude), but adapted to leverage our existing dev-docs pattern:

1. **External orchestrator** spawns Claude CLI sessions
2. **Dashboard** monitors context % via JSONL file watching (already built)
3. **At threshold** (70%), orchestrator terminates current session
4. **New session** starts, runs `/session-init`, picks up from dev-docs
5. **Loop continues** until task complete

### Key Insight
Unlike continuous-claude which passes state via prompt injection, our approach:
- State lives on disk (dev-docs 3-file pattern)
- Each session runs `/session-init` to load context (~400 tokens)
- No external prompt building needed - Claude reads its own state

### Components to Build
1. `continuous-loop.js` - Orchestrator that spawns/monitors/cycles sessions
2. Session series tracking in dashboard
3. Graceful termination handling

## Recent Achievements (Session 2025-12-14)

### ⚠️ Session 8: Critical Discovery - Monitoring System Not Tracking Real Context

**CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED**: The entire monitoring framework uses simulated data (60% fake usage) while real Claude context reached 97%. The system provides no actual value until this is fixed.

#### Critical Findings:
1. **Monitoring Shows Fake Data**: Dashboard displays 60% usage from Math.random() simulation
2. **Real Context at 97%**: Actual Claude session nearly exhausted while monitors showed green
3. **No Real Integration**: No API connection to Claude Code's actual context tracking
4. **Emergency Checkpoint Failed**: Auto-checkpoint at 70% never triggered (uses fake data)
5. **Manual Save Required**: Had to manually trigger checkpoint at 92% context

#### Work Completed Before Context Exhaustion:
1. **Singleton Monitor Launcher** (`start-monitor-singleton.js`)
   - Prevents duplicate monitor instances
   - Checks ports and PID files
   - Graceful handling of existing instances

2. **Protected Production Start** (`production/start-with-protection.js`)
   - Comprehensive port checking before startup
   - PID file management for process tracking
   - Lock file mechanism to prevent race conditions
   - Clear error messages with remediation steps

3. **Session Initialization Protocol** (`SESSION_INIT.md`)
   - Prompts user to start monitoring at session begin
   - Documents monitoring framework benefits
   - Quick commands for management

4. **Fixed StateManager Bug** (`scripts/start-enhanced-dashboard.js`)
   - Changed from object to string path parameter
   - Resolved initialization errors

#### Critical Next Steps After Reload:
1. **Implement Real Context Tracking** - Connect to Claude Code's actual API
2. **Remove All Simulated Data** - Replace Math.random() with real metrics
3. **Test Emergency Triggers** - Ensure 70% checkpoint actually fires
4. **Add Continuous Loop Toggle** - Dashboard UI control (user requested)
