# Learning Systems Section (for FRAMEWORK-OVERVIEW.md)

This comprehensive learning systems section documents all 6 learning systems in the framework and should be inserted into FRAMEWORK-OVERVIEW.md after the Skills Framework section.

The framework includes **six interconnected learning systems** that enable continuous improvement by capturing, analyzing, and leveraging historical execution data.

Key learning systems:
1. Persistent Memory System (MemoryStore)
2. Semantic Search System (VectorStore)
3. Intelligent Context Loading (ContextRetriever)
4. AI-Powered Observation Extraction (AICategorizationService)
5. Pattern Recommendation System (PatternRecommender)
6. Usage Analytics & Cost Learning (UsageTracker)

Each system learns different aspects and works together to create comprehensive organizational knowledge that improves agent performance over time.
